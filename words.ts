export const dadJoke = `I can't fucking take it. I say an accidental "I'm" statement and then I see it, I fucking see it. "Hi 'hungry'" it started as. That's funny, that's a cool reference. But I kept going, I'd say "I'm going to go to homework rn",  I'd say I'm going to eat an animated bag of chips I'd say I'm going to wear a hat And every time I'd burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh staring at the image as the words "Hi going to wear a hat". It's torment, psychological torture, I am being conditioned to laugh maniacly any time I see a "hi going to do homework rn". I can't fucking live like this... I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't! And don't get me fucking started on the words! I'll never hear the word "I'm" again without thinking of "Hello"  Someone says "I'm feeling bad rn" I can't say anything other than "hi feeling bad rn." I could watch a man murder everyone I love and all I would be able to say is "hi killing everyone I love" and laugh like a fucking insane person. And the word "I'm" is ruined. The phrase "Hi" is ruined. I can't live anymore. The Dad Jokes destroyed my fucking life. I want to eject myself from this plane of existence. MAKE IT STOP!`
